# Handling States in React

- This is a game created using React. It involves 2 players who play against each other. Red and Green colours are used to represent each player who wins the game by connecting 4 circles. The circles can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
- The 2 players can be human or one of them can be a computer. Thus a button named computer is provided for that purpose.
